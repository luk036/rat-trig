/**
 * @file trigonom.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of rational trigonometry functions
 * 
 * This file contains the implementation of the rational trigonometry functions
 * declared in trigonom.hpp. Since most functions are templated and defined
 * inline in the header, this file is mostly for documentation purposes.
 * 
 * Rational Trigonometry is a new approach to classical trigonometry, developed by Norman
 * Wildberger, that aims to simplify and clarify the subject by using only rational numbers
 * and operations, rather than irrational numbers and limits.
